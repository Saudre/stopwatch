# Overview

Stopwatch is a free and open-source app written in vanilla Javascript. 

The app's primary goal is to simulate a stopwatch that can save multiple records and lets you download those records in a CSV file to your local device. 

The app uses local storage to keep persisting memory over records and avoid having a database.

By default, the app has a limit of 50 records, but that can easily change by modifying `storageLimit` at **main.js**.

You can check out the live version [here](https://saudre.com/work/apps/stopwatch/)

The app is also available in Spanish on the [Spanish version of my website](https://saudre.com/es/obra/apps/cronometro/)

Currently, I am working on a blog post for my website: [saudre.com](https://saudre.com/) explaining its development and the code structure. As soon as I finish the blog post, I will drop a link to the post here.
